Securing access to the Neo4j Server
===================================

Per default, the Neo4j Server is bundled with a Jetty instance that binds to host +localhost+ on port +7474+, answering only requests from the local machine. 

If you need to enable access from external machines, configure Jetty in the +conf/neo4j-server.properties+ by setting the related properties, e.g for access by any host, do

[IMPORTANT]
The neo4j server exposes remote scripting functionality by default that allow full access to the underlying system. 
Exposing your server without an added security layer (see below) poses a severe security threat.

----
# http port (for all data, administrative, and UI access)
org.neo4j.server.webserver.port=7474

#let the webserver only listen on the specified IP. Default
#is localhost (only accept local connections). Uncomment to allow
#any connection.
#org.neo4j.server.webserver.address=0.0.0.0
----

The Neo4j server currently does not enforce security on the REST access layer.
This should be taken care of by external means.
We strongly recommend to front a running Neo4j Server with a proxy like Apache `mod_proxy` footnote:[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html].
This provides a number of advantages:

* Control access to the Neo4j server to specific IP addresses, URL patterns and IP ranges. This can be used to make for instance only the +/db/data+ namespace accessible to non-local clients, while the +/db/admin+ URLs only respond to a specific IP address.
