1.4.M02 (2011-05-12)
--------------------
o Upgraded lucene version to 3.1

1.3.M05 (2011-03-24)
--------------------
o Updated documentation
o Moved QueryContext and ValueContext to be part of API

1.3.M04 (2011-03-10)
--------------------
o Fixed an issue where batch inserter indexes would ignore numeric values.
o Fixed an issue which could result in batch inserted indexes trying to grab too much memory.

1.3.M03 (2011-02-24)
-------------------
o Fixed a bug where the use of ValueContext was ignored during batch insertion.
o Added some more convenient Index#remove methods.

1.3.M02 (2011-02-10)
------------------------
o Broke neo4j-shell dependency.
o Fixes a bug with the execution of RemoveCommand that could cause NPE during recovery.
o Added a timeline index implementation based on lucene.
o Uncommitted changes to index can now be searched within the same transaction.

0.5-1.3.M01 (2011-01-27)
------------------------

o Can participate in online backups, where the full index files are requested.
o Fix for a NPE that could occur in IndexHits#size() if that was the first method called on the instance.
o Fix for a recovery issue which occured when there had only been modifications to relationship indexes.
o IndexHits#close() is run in the finalizer as a safety net, although best practice is to call it your self.

0.2-1.2 (2010-12-29)
--------------------

o No changes.

0.2-1.2.M06 (2010-12-21)
------------------------

o More flexible caching (can instantiate an arbitrary Cache object).

o Merged the fast-writes branch. Basically it makes committing changes to lucene indexes
  faster and more throughput-friendly for multiple threads. The performance improvement
  for committing lucene transactions shows best for small transactions, but will improve
  all modifying operations to lucene indexes.

o Fixed bug which could close an IndexSearcher before it was supposed to when
  there was exactly one item in the result set, two or more threads did this at
  the same time as there was another thread doing an update... AND the reading
  threads all called IndexHits#getSingle() on the result.


0.2-1.2.M05 (2010-12-02)
------------------------

o Added IndexHits#currentScore which exposes the most recently fetched
  IndexHits item's score from the search, if any.

0.2-1.2.M04 (2010-11-18)
------------------------
o Index configuration handling moved to IndexManager (graphDb.index()) and added
setConfiguration/removeConfiguration which can modify index configuration, but
could render existing index data invalid if wrong settings are modified, so
consider those advanced.

o Made config recognition more flexible for forNodes(indexName,config) and
forRelationships(indexName,config) so that the config can contain differences,
just as long as they yield the same storage format.

0.2-1.2.M03 (2010-11-04)
------------------------

o Added support for modifying index configurations as well as listing
  and deleting indexes and index configurations.

-API
o Added Index#getName() and Index#getConfiguration()
o Added IndexManager#nodeIndexNames() and #relationshipIndexNames()

0.2-1.2.M02 (2010-10-21)
------------------------

o Moved to be an official and supported neo4j component.
o The Index API moved to kernel, this component merely provides an
  implementation.
